# To do

## Additional cases to handle

- [x] The game should not start without at least 2 players
- [x] The game should end as soon as one player reaches 6 points
- [x] What happens if there is no question left in a category? End of the game and the player with the highest score wins?
- [x] If a player is in penalty box and rolls an even number, they stay in penalty box but no question should be asked, while it is the case currently.
